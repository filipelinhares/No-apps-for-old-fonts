## Typeface Mixing

1. Don't choose two fonts from the same style (humanist, geometric, etc).
2. Don't choose two fonts from the same class (serif, sans-serif).

*Choose fonts that share one thing in common but are otherwise different, like humanist serif and humanist sans.
And that trait can even be largely abstract, like a transitional serif and a humanist sans*

All in all, you should strive for contrast over harmony. A good rule to thumb to follow, when mixing typefaces is keep it the same or change a lot, look for emphatic differences rather than mushy transitions.

Don't feel obligated to pick two fonts for your project, a simple typeface is often enough. And this for beginner is the ideal, you can practice and learn more using different weights before try to incorporate many others typefaces.

## Sizes

*A good size is 16px.*
*The headline can be anywhere from 200% to 300%.*

### Leading
- Leading too large negatively affects readability, as the eye has to move further between the lines of text, and can easily get lost.
- Leading that is too small can create a cramped or claustrophobic fell that rushes the reader.

*Good leading is around 120 and 150% of the body copy size.*

### Line width
*Keep 50 to 70 characters per line including spaces id ideal.*

- Using too much bold can muddy your hierarchy.
- Make sure the bold and italic complement the default value.
